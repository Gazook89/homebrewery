What does “open source” mean?
	All the fonts hosted on Velvetyne are libre and open-source. This means that you can :

	3. redistribute them
	4. redistribute the modified versions.
	These rules are true for all personal and commercial works.

What can I do with your fonts?
	Velvetyne fonts can be utilized across a spectrum of mediums: posters, logos, magazines, websites, apps, t-shirts, music videos, bike trailers… **Remember to credit the type designer and our foundry whenever you employ one of our fonts.** Should any aspect of our fonts not align with your preferences or requirements, you are at liberty to modify it to suit your needs. In such instances, it’s necessary to redistribute your creation under the same license as the original typeface. Feel free to send us the modified versions of our fonts; we welcome your forks!”

I wanted to use one of your typefaces, but it lacks some characters I need. What can I do?
	Our fonts are libre, which means you have the freedom to modify and enhance them by adding missing glyphs. If you’ve created an upgraded version, please email us with your new iteration, as we might be interested in releasing this enhanced version. If you lack the skills for font modification or don’t have access to someone with those skills, simply reach out to us (or directly to the font’s author) via email. We’ll assess what assistance we can offer, whether free or for a fee, based on the extent of work required.

I want to use one of your fonts, but I can’t credit. What should I do?
	We understand that it’s sometimes challenging to credit our fonts, especially for logos, on small-print surfaces or promotional materials. In such cases, you can utilize our fonts without credit on the product, but it’s essential to mention the font’s name, the author, and the foundry whenever you publish photos of the product online (on the product’s page, Instagram posts, or your portfolio page). For instance: ‘Terminal Grotesque by Raphaël Bastide (Velvetyne Type Foundry)’ (or a similar formula). When sharing images of your creations on Instagram, Are.na or Mastodon featuring Velvetyne fonts, you can tag us or use the #velvetyne_type_foundry hashtag, allowing us to discover them. If you regularly use our fonts for commercial projects, consider making a donation, though it’s not obligatory.

Does making a donation exempt me from crediting a typeface?
	Donations are greatly appreciated as they support our ongoing activities, website maintenance, and the development of new, exciting projects. However, they do not replace the requirement for crediting. Therefore, no donation can exempt you from crediting. Get more informations about donations.

Can I truly do anything I want with your fonts?
	Even if you could, which you can’t, it doesn’t mean you should. We emphasize not just the legal aspects but also ethical and cultural values. Please respect and align with these values. Remember, behind this website are individuals who have feelings and invest time and effort to create a better universe. Consider their perspective before exploiting their work.
